## Post-Release Tasks

### Immediate (Day 1)

- [ ] **Verify GitHub Release**: Check that release is visible and properly formatted
- [ ] **Test NPM Package**: Install fresh copy and run basic tests
  ```bash
  npm install node-windows-audio-capture@2.5.0
  node -e "const {AudioCapture} = require('node-windows-audio-capture'); console.log('✅ Package loads');"
  ```
- [ ] **Update Project Website** (if exists): Reflect new version and features
- [ ] **Announcement Post**: Write blog/announcement about v2.5.0

### Follow-up (Week 1)

- [ ] **Monitor GitHub Issues**: Watch for bug reports or feedback
- [ ] **Monitor NPM Downloads**: Track adoption rate
- [ ] **Engage with Users**: Respond to questions and feedback
- [ ] **Collect Performance Data**: Real-world usage metrics if available

### Planning (Week 2+)

- [ ] **Retrospective**: Review what went well and what could be improved
- [ ] **Roadmap Update**: Plan v2.6.0 based on feedback and findings
- [ ] **Documentation Improvements**: Update FAQ with common questions
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Set up telemetry if not already in place

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

### If Critical Issues Found

1. **Create hotfix branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b hotfix/v2.5.1 v2.5.0
   # Fix the issue
   git commit -m "fix: critical issue description"
   ```

2. **Release v2.5.1**:
   - Follow same release process
   - Mark as critical update in release notes

3. **Deprecate v2.5.0**:
   - Update v2.5.0 release notes with warning
   - Recommend immediate upgrade to v2.5.1

### If Major Issues Found

1. **Yank npm package** (if published):
   ```bash
   npm unpublish node-windows-audio-capture@2.5.0
   ```

2. **Update GitHub Release**:
   - Mark as "Not recommended for production"
   - Link to stable version (v2.4.0)

3. **Revert main branch**:
